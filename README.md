# What is included

  - Images used
  - Image sets
  - Annotations (in PascalVOC format)
  - class names
  - Image and video files to test the model after training

# Folder structure
  - **Annotations:** Contains all the image annotations in PascalVOC format
  - **data** Contains the names file with the classes names
  - **ImageSets** Contains the files with the image sets used for training and validation
  - **JPEGImages** Contains all the current images used for training
  - **tfrecords** Contains the latest tfrecords used to traing with YoloV3
